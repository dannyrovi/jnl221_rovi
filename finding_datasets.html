Link: Crime Incidents from 2024 (CSV) (City of Philadelphia)

How is this data organized and collected? 
The data is organized by filters such as when the crime occurred, what type of crime occurred, and exact latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates along with street names and numbers.

Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?
This is extremely newsworthy as my home region of Philadelphia has been heavily affected by crime, especially in recent history. This dataset is meant to broaden perspectives on the total number of crimes that occur within a year-long span. Any local residents from Philadelphia or its surrounding residents can make use of this data.

What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?
“In 2024, violent crimes were disproportionately concentrated in specific Philadelphia police districts with higher poverty rates, while property crimes were more evenly distributed across the city.”</p>

How is this data organized and collected?
The NFL 2025 passing yard dataset is collected from official league game stats and organized by player with totals like yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and completion rates. However, this particular dataset is mainly centered around passing yards, which define the “leaders” in passing for any given season.

Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?
This dataset is updated in real time with credible fact-checking from posted box scores. This is a newsworthy data set because it is constantly updated week-by-week, and fans of the NFL can consistently check on who is leading the league in passing performance.

What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?
“Quarterbacks on teams with top offensive lines will show significantly higher passing efficiency stats than quarterbacks on teams with weaker pass protection.” </p>
