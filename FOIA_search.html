			<p> The FOIA request asks for all records since January 2005 about the agencyâ€™s use of drones. It covers several categories: acquisition documents, like contracts, proposals, budgets, grants, insurance, FAA approvals, and related communications; equipment records, such as inventories and maintenance logs; policy materials, including manuals, approved-use communications, and agreements with other groups; training documents, like curricula, logs, certifications, and costs; and usage records, including flight logs and any reprimands for misuse. The requester, Mr. Musgrave, also asked that his fees be waived since the information will be shared publicly for journalism purposes, but wants advance notice if fees apply. They prefer the records be sent electronically and request a response within five business days, as required by law.
